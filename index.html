                        <p>Mathcraft uses <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> to teach math in a collaborative game environment.  The course is applicable for grades 3rd through 7th and is aligned to Common Core math standards.</p>
                        <p>I recommend you sample the first five minutes of the video get a feel for my editing abilities.  The video is paced for voiceover, but there is no audio track currently in this video.</p>
                        <p>The images below are used in the video.  They were created in Photoshop and styled to match CodeRev's branding.</p>

                    <p>The course is targeted toward middle and high school students.  It seeks to teach students the fundamentals of the C# programming language and 3d game development.
                    The video is intended to be used as a substitute or supplement for teacher lecture, especially in the case where the teacher is not technically inclined.</p>
                    <p>The video was captured in Open Broadcast Software and edited on my computer in Sony Vegas. I recording the voiceover myself and I am speaking on the video.</p>
